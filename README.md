# Batman Website

-A website made by me for my college project with a brief description of batman character and a quiz game including questions about batman and person or villains realted to him.


-I have used HTML CSS and JavaScript in creating this website and also used jquery in creating a loding page for the website.

-The loading page is created with CSS and jquery and provides an a realistic loading effect to the website.
